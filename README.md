## [描述](https://github.com/sochub/STM8S90/wiki) 

[STM8S903](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm8s-application-specific-line.html) offers the same standard set of features as the STM8S103/105: full set of timers, interfaces (UART, SPI, I²C), 10-bit ADC, internal and external clock control system, watchdogs, auto wake-up unit and an integrated single-wire debug module. 

STM8S903 is based on 16 MHz core and 20-32 pin packages. The Flash memory is 8 Kbytes, with 640 bytes of data EEPROM and 1 Kbyte of RAM.
